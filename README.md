# Pupil distance estimation using card on forehead

### Measuring Pupil Distance (PD) from an image using card on forehead

By : [Tanishq Selot](https://github.com/tanishq150802)

## Requirements
* Python 3.10
* Numpy
* dlib
* OpenCV
* imutils

All the code is contained within **pupil_detect.ipynb**. Image examples can be seen in the folders (each one has its own README.md).

### Webcam Flow **cam.py**

* When the code runs, webcam starts.
* User can adjust his/her face at the center and press **space** to capture the image.
* Captured image is displayed, press **esc** to calculate PD.
* PD line is drawn and calculated PD is shown.
* Further press **esc** to escape the window.

### Steps

* The card on forehead is detected using HSV and Adaptive thresholding.
* A bounding box is drawn around the card and its width is calculated.
* Haarcascade classifier gave best results for pupil detection.
* The left and right pupil coordinates can also be detected using dlib library.
* The PD is calculated in terms of pixels using Euclidean distance.
* The width of a credit card is 8.56 cm.
* This data along with scaling formula is used to calculate the PD in cm.
* A variable PARALLEL_PLANE_SCALING_FACTOR is multiplied to take into consideration the depth and camera calibration aspects.
* PARALLEL_PLANE_SCALING_FACTOR is 1.27 in my case.

### Example
